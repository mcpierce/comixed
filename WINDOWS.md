# Running ComiXed On Windows

This document describes how to run ComiXed on a Windows machine.

## Configuration

After installation, the file:

    %LOCALAPPDATA%\ComiXed\example-application.properties

needs to be renamed to:

    %LOCALAPPDATA%\ComiXed\application.properties

and then edited to reflect your runtime environment. This prevents an
existing system's configuration from getting overwritten when an
upgrade is installed.

See the QUICKSTART.md file for the changes needed
